In order to connect to the database, a file called "database.properties" has to be created in the root folder.
The file has to follow the exact structure as below (remove the < and > and everything between them):

url=jdbc:postgresql://<insert db host here, without port, which is set to 5432 by default>/
user=<insert the username here>
passwd=<insert the password here>

This file contains the db connection credentials, that's why it has not been added to git.
